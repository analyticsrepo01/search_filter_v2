      "Coverage of Cancer Drug Treatment and Cancer Drug Service\n",
      "The Ministry of Health (MOH) has released new guidelines on the cancer drug treatments that can be covered by Integrated Shield Plans. As part of efforts to reduce the cost of cancer drug treatment and keep premiums sustainable in the long-term, MOH has developed a Cancer Drug List (CDL). The CDL comprises clinically proven and more cost-effective cancer drug treatments (i.e., drugs paired with specified clinical indications, dosage form & strength, for which the drugs can be administered).\n",
      "From 1 September 2022, only cancer drug treatment that are listed on the CDL and administered as per the CDL will be claimable from MediShield Life (MSHL) and MediSave (MSV). For Integrated Shield Plans (including PRUShield), the same change will take effect for policies renewed or purchased on or after 1 April 2023.\n",
      "If a cancer drug treatment is not listed or not administered exactly as described in the CDL, it will not be claimable. However, customers with a PRUExtra rider will still receive up to S$150,000 coverage on selected cancer drug treatments not listed per the CDL.\n",
      "The CDL is published on MOH’s website at https://go.gov.sg/moh-cancerdruglist and currently covers most cancer drug treatments approved by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA). MOH will update it every few months to keep up with medical advancements and the latest clinical evidence.\n",
      "With these changes, your policy’s Outpatient Cancer Treatment benefit will be replaced with 2 new benefits; Cancer Drug Treatment benefit and Cancer Drug Services benefit; for policies renewed or purchased on or after 1 April 2023.\n",
      "Cancer Drug Treatment benefit – Only cancer drug treatments administered as specified on the CDL will be claimable under your Policy, up to the treatment-specific claim limits. Selected outpatient cancer drug treatments beyond the CDL will be claimable under riders. If you are currently undergoing cancer treatment, please consult your doctor early on whether your treatment is on the CDL.\n",
      "Cancer Drug Services benefit – Services that are part of a cancer drug treatment (including treatments not on the CDL), such as consultations, scans, lab investigations, treatment preparation and administration, supportive care drugs and blood transfusions, will be claimable under the Cancer Drug Services benefit, up to specified claims limits.\n",
      "Further to that, effective from 1 December 2023, MOH has provided higher MSHL and MSV limits for patients with multiple primary cancers:\n",
      "(i)\n",
      "For cancer drug treatment, the limit is the sum of the highest cancer drug treatment limit among the claimable treatments received for each primary cancer in that month; and\n",
      "(ii)\n",
      "For cancer drug services, the limit is twice the current limit for patients with one primary cancer if the patient had received treatment for multiple primary cancers at any point in time within the same Policy Year.\n",
